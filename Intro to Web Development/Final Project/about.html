                    My name is Nazar Viznytsya. I was born in Lviv, Ukraine; however, my parents and I moved to Winnipeg
                    on Victoria Day Weekend 2010. Within a year of landing in Winnipeg, my family had settled into the
                    house where the four of us (My parents, me, and my three-year-old younger sister) currently reside.
                    I do not remember much about Ukraine as we arrived when I was four and a half. I also have not been
                    back to Ukraine since then, but I hope to go sometime soon.

                    When I was younger, I found it hard to find something I could commit myself to long-term. The
                    novelty of a new extracurricular or a sport I had never tried before would lure me in for about a
                    year. Then the novelty would wear off, and my interest would fade. Around grade six, however, my
                    friend Neil introduced me to this cool thing called programming in C#. For whatever reason, it was
                    the one thing that did not lose its novelty. I would expand my programming skillset through the
                    years. I even let it decide my high school choice.

                    When I got into PTEC two years ago, I already had my sights set on doing Software Development at
                    MITT. I did not neglect cyber defence and cloud administration. I learned a lot and got good at it.
                    Participating in and winning cyber security competitions but It just never had the same allure as
                    software development did. Being able to create something that’s truly your own from the ground up -
                    there’s nothing quite like it. Same with the thrill of finally having that one feature that you’ve
                    spent hours working on finally compiling and working. Cyber security and cloud administration just
                    didn’t offer that.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">I am passionate about one day creating something used by millions or billions of
                    people to better their lives. To accomplish what technology is meant to do, make life easier.
                    Whether from a startup I create or working at a large tech company, that does not matter. The drive
                    comes from the knowledge that everyday people’s lives will be better because of my code.</p>

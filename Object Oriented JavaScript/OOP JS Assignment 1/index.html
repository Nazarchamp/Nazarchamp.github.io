            </div>
            <article>
                <p class="article-p">Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of if not the most used programming
                    paradigm in the world. Languages that implement OOP are some of the most used in the world and other
                    commonly used programming languages that started out as only functional have developed OOP
                    principles.
                    In this blog post we'll go over important concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
                </p>
                <h2>Classes</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    A class is a template of an object. It defines the initial values of the properties within the
                    class, and it also defines the behaviour of its objects (Methods). Classes can also exist in a
                    static sense where they are not tied to any given object, and exist from when it's constructed
                    (Typically the start of the program), to the end of the program.
                </p>

                <h2>Objects</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    An object is an instantiated version of a class. It is some amount of memory that has been allocated
                    in the way set out in the class. There can be several objects of the same class within a program and
                    each of these is called an instance of the parent class. Think of a class as a car, and objects can
                    be Ford F150, Honda Civic, Toyota Prius. They're all different cars, but they still all have the
                    same basic car properties like an engine and four wheels.
                </p>

                <h2>Constructors</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Constructors are special types of methods which are used to create instances of classes. These
                    constructors have the same name as the class which they are instantiating and can prepare the object
                    by defining initial values. Note that static classes cannot have a constructor since they cannot be
                    instantiated.
                </p>

                <h2>Accessor Methods</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Accessor methods typically come in two main types: getters and setters. These are special types of
                    methods that typically are bound to properties within an
                    object. A getter method is the method which is called when a property inside a class is read,
                    typically it returns just the property, although it can format properties to meet a specific
                    standard. A setter is the method which is used to set a property, setters can have input
                    validation/parsing, and can also be configured to set the values of several variables. A property
                    that doesn't have a getter means it cannot be read, and a property that doesn't have a setter means
                    it can't be set.
                </p>

                <h2>Interfaces</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Interfaces define the input and output of the objects in terms of their methods. These methods
                    include accessor methods that are accessible outside the class. However, interfaces do not
                    define the behaviour of an object, they only define what methods an object has, not what the
                    methods do. An object can have several interfaces. Think of interfaces as the buttons and ports
                    on your computer, it has a power button, but you don't know what the power button will do, but
                    you know that your computer can't bake cookies because it doesn't have a compartment to put them
                    in.
                </p>

                <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Abstraction is the principle that you only provide the information that is relevant to the user, and
                    that you "hide" all information that is not relevant to them. For instance, if you are searching up
                    cookie recipes on the internet, you do not care about the routers which your HTTP packets visit, or
                    the DNS server you used to resolve the URL.
                </p>

                <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Encapsulation is the first pillar of Object Oriented Programming, it states that classes and objects
                    should be able to control which properties and methods are accessible outside the class and in
                    what manner they are accessible. We accomplish this by setting properties and methods to public or
                    private(Or special mixes of the two in some languages). This
                    limits the potential for coding errors, creates simpler interaction with classes, and limits the
                    attack surface providing a bit more cybersecurity.
                </p>

                <h2>Inheritance</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Inheritance is another pillar of Object Oriented Programming. It is the ability for a class to be
                    able to inherit properties and methods of other
                    classes. This happens by deriving a class from another class if <b>Class B</b> is derived from
                    <b>Class A</b>, then <b>Class B</b> has all of <b>Class A</b>'s public and private properties and
                    methods. Note that <b>Class A</b> will not have <b>Class B</b>'s properties or methods.
                </p>

                <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Polymorphism is the final pillar of Object Oriented Programming. It is the ability for a class to
                    take on several unique versions. Classes can implement
                    virtual methods that derived classes will override. For instance take the example of a class <b>Animal</b>,
                    with derived classes <b>Dog</b>, <b>Cat</b>, <b>Bird</b>. The Animal class can have the virtual
                    method <b>Speak()</b> and
                    each of the animals would override it with the sound that they make.
                </p>

                <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
                <p class="article-p">
                    A design pattern is a reusable solution to a problem that commonly occurs. The most common and first
                    taught design principle is: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). DRY is simply if you're writing the same code
                    several times create a method to do it in less lines. This also applies to changing hard coded
                    values to variables. Object Oriented Programming has some specific design principles too. There are
                    lots of them, but a well known one is the Open Closed Principle. This principle states that classes
                    should be open for extension and closed for modification. For example if you have a class
                    <b>Shape</b> and it has a method <b>GetArea()</b> that only calculates area the way rectangles do it (Length x Width) then to make a
                    triangle you would need to modify the <b>GetArea()</b> method. It would be Open Closed Principle if shape had a virtual method
                    of <b>GetArea()</b>, and derived classes existed for different shapes.
